# final-project-telecom-services-
 Created a basic web app project for telecom services using maven (a project managment tool).
 The technology used was java,spring,oracle and jsp
 Here the user has to enter some basic details to sign in.After signing in all the users details will be displayed in the same order on another web page.
 Also if we add a certain amount to the current balance of the user then that new balance will also be displayed.
 I used jsp for if the user enter incorrect details then a pop up will come stating incorrect number or password and try again.
